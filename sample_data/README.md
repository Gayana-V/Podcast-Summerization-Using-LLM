# Sample Data

This directory contains demonstration assets to help you validate the PodSummarize pipeline without needing to download an external podcast.

## Files

- `sample_episode.mp3` – A short, license-free podcast clip (placeholder). Replace with your own file or download the demo clip referenced in the main README.
- `sample_transcript.json` – Whisper-style transcript segments generated from the sample clip.
- `sample_summary.json` – Example output from the summarization LLM, including per-speaker highlights.

> The audio file is not bundled in this repository to keep the footprint small. Follow the instructions in the README to download a sample and place it in this folder with the expected filename.
